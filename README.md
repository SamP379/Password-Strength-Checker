# Password Strength Checker

## A Python script to check the strength of a password 

This is a Python script to check the strength of a password using the zxcvbn library.
The script also uses the llama3.2 Large Language Model to create an AI-generated joke
about the password, along with feedback on the password. The project was a good chance 
to learn about LLMs and how to use them locally in a Python script.
